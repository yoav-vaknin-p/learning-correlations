# Inter-Layer Correlations in a Learning Neural Network

Installed packages appear on PackagesUsed file. important ones are torch and torchvision.

<b>Overview</b> <br>
In this project we aim to find simple sub-structures of low dimension from activation patterns a neural network layer displays while learning.
We extract the data from the NN's 3 hidden layers as well as from it's output layer.
We perform low-rank PARAFAC \ CANDECOMP tensor decomposition to find those simple low dimension sub-structures.
