# NNLayerCorrelations


Installed packages appear on PackagesUsed file. important ones are torch and torchvision.

<b>Overview</b> <br>
In this project we aim to find simple sub-structures of low dimension from activation patterns a neural network displays while learning.
We extract the data from the NN's 3 hidden layers as well as from the output layer.
Over the data we will run a low-rank tensor decomposition.
We will calculate a confusion matrix per-layer, and find the differences between layers of the NN.
